It's \" The Worst Economic Recovery Since The Great Depression \"       Nu Obs & Ops News, Observations and Opinions with a Sensa Humah     9/6/13: Underway:  Preparations for War. The US has ordered nonessential personnel out of our embassy in Beirut Lebanon because of security concerns.   The US has four Navy destroyers deployed to the Mediterranean within firing distance of Syria, and the USS San Antonio an amphibious ship nearby --   even as Congress debates approval for President Obama’s plan to attack in reaction to claims that the Syrian government used chemical weapons on civilians.    The US has now moved military assets to areas not far from expected military action, including the USS Nimitz aircraft carrier and three destroyers in the Red Sea, according to the Wall St. Journal.     Diplomatic missions are said to be working with the military to tighten security at embassies in the Middle East and Africa.   Marines in the area are said to be on standby at various locations.   The state dept says terrorist activity in Iraq is at levels unseen since 2008.    An order has been intercepted from Iran to militants calling for an attack on the US embassy in Iraq should there be an attack on Syria – in which case Iran says it will stand with and defend Syria quote to the end.   And unprecedented, a former Iranian official warns that following an attack there will be mass kidnappings and   brutal killings of Americans around the world.   Now, CBS News says the Pentagon has expanded its plans for bombings in Syria to include new targets since Syria is moving its military around – and more Russian naval vessels are on their way to the Mediterranean.   8-28-13: Rand Paul may wonder if we're being played for dummies The ft. Hood shooter has said he welcomes the path to martyrdom that the death penalty will give him.   With today’s sentence for his 2009 murders, he’s got it. The Obama administration continues to say chemical weapons were used in Syria, and US forces are in place for a two or three day attack on about 50 Syrian targets in order to punish president Bashar al Assad for using those weapons.   Attacks to begin within days.   International analysts say prepare for terrorist attacks on Western targets as soon as the first shot is fired.   The price of oil and therefore our gasoline remains to be seen after that shot is fired.   Israel is handing out gas masks to civilians.   Russia and China are against our opening fire on Syria, and they’re using the United Nations to register their dissention, asking why we’re not waiting for UN weapons inspectors to make a report before the bombing is to begin.    The UN is expected to authorize the use of force by the US against Syria.    So have we seen real proof of the chemical attack or the trail of evidence? Ron Paul’s son Rand Paul asks the question today –Is it possible that the anti-government forces in Syria are the ones who actually used those chemical weapons on civilians so that the US would attack the Assad government?   Either way, Texas Senator John Cornyn and two or three dozen other Congresspeople are demanding that President Obama bring his case to Congress, as the Constitution demands, before any attack. When states such as Texas began push Planned Parenthood out of the government funded abortion business, pro-abortion forces began thinking of a way to open the business back up again.   One answer from California state Democrat Toni Atkins – a bill that would allow physician assistants, nurse practitioners and certified nurse midwives to perform abortions, anytime.       The fiftieth anniversary march on Washington, 10s of thousands turned out, but it’s gone quite political with the unwritten invitation to Democrats only, excluding America’s only black senator – he’s a Republican. 8-27-13: Adventures In Syria The situation in Syria has deteriorated – some say there are few options for the Western allies left.    As US Army major David French puts it so eloquently, the failure by the Obama administration to make a decision has put us in a bad situation -- there was not long ago a rebellion by relatively moderate people in Syria, the kind of people who would welcome help from the US.   But the US sat on the sidelines because it wanted to engage with Syrian leader Bashir Al Assad the same way it had with the regime in Iran.   Talking about possible peace talks.   But as the rebels in Syrian started to fight, they started to lose battle after battle, so jihadists began to move in from all over the middle east.   They joined the rebels to try to take down the Assad regime.   But while the Obama administration sat on the sideline, jihadists and al Qaeda fighters took over the rebel cause.   Now, 100-thousand dead civilians later, we can’t buddy up to Assad and the jihadist rebels don’t really want to alighn with us, though they will take whatever aid we offer them.   But are those rebels working with us or are their interests similar to ours?   No.   WE have in common with the rebels in Syria little more than contempt for Bashir Al assad.   We’re working alongside al Qaeda here.   And after the use of chemical weapons, we’re left few options other than bombing campaigns.   Word is US air strikes will target half a dozen air fields in Syria plus military installations – warplanes will fly from Cypress and cruise missiles may be lobbed from one of the four destroyers the US has in Mediterranean.   One news organization says the US bombing operation will start Thursday – another says it will last three days.   If we’re being told this so are Assad, al Qaeda, the Iranian Mullahs, the Saudi Sheiks and the Muslim Brotherhood.   Is the release of all this information in the best interests of our efforts in the middle east?   Russian Deputy Premier Dimitri Rogozin says in the case of Syria today, the western powers are acting in the Islamic world like, quote a monkey with a hand grenade. Is Obamacare falling apart? The Chicago Tribune notes in an editorial that the Affordable Care Act (Obamacare) is deeply flawed and it's not helping that President Obama keeps flouting Capital Hill's powers to amend it.  Maybe Obama feels that Congress is so useless he needs to take on their duties.  Reconfiguring GDP History Richmond Virginia is considering an interesting plan to deal with heartless banks throwing out of their homes people who owe more on their mortgages than the homes are worth.   Richmond may buy the houses   – sell them at below market value to satisfy loans.   Banks won’t work with them?   Richmond says take ownership of the homes under eminent domain laws, then force the banks to negotiate to keep homeowners in their homes. The best way to make people think things are getting better is to twist the statistics – which the government has been doing for decades with the unemployment figures.   The current unemployment rate of 14 percent has been lowered to 7.6 percent by twisting the statistics.   Now with the Gross Domestic Product.    Now, the Commerce Dept has revised the way it estimates the basic size of the US economy.   So a less than one percent GDP is now one and eight tenths of a percent, which is more than Wall St. Exected and caused excitement in the money markets.  But the Commerce Dept. took it a step further and reconfigured the GDP going all the way back to 1929.  We can't wait to dig into those numbers. President Obama is \"frustrated with our republic,\" with the way it works. That’s the estimation of Florida Sen. Marco Rubio, commenting on Obama’s speech this morning calling for more control on guns and gun owners. Rubio says that when Obama made 23 executive orders instead of allowing the gun control debate to fully go to Congress, Obama was abusing his power and ignoring the constitution. But there are analysts on Capital Hill who say Obama’s challenge to Congress to ban certain weapons is being met with little enthusiasm by members of Congress.  So what's the difference?   New York, Atlanta and other outposts of The Universe It’s the biggest thing in the universe.   The Royal Astronomical Society says an international team of researchers has found the largest known structure in the universe – a big clump of quasars – which are the center of galaxies – quasars that are lumped together in a mass so big it’s mind boggling even to astronomers.   So big, seriously, that if you wanted to cross this mass of outer space matter in a starship   -- travelling at the speed of light – it would still take you about 4 billion years to cross it.   Here in the United States, what are people in general concerned about?   Gun laws?   A Gallup poll says people are worried about the state of the economy in general – then the budget deficit second – dissatisfaction with government third.   And then, fourth, unemployment; fifth, lack of money; sixth, taxes – then gun control. An Atlanta man named Larry Ward has designated this Saturday as Gun Appreciation Day.    He says it may be coincidental that it's just hours before the president’s inauguration.   Word is spreading fast and gun appreciation events are being scheduled nationwide.   Fitch’s rating service says the US will see a credit downgrade if Congress and Obama don’t raise the debt ceiling. Dell computer is treading water on the markets – stock down 40-percent over the past five years – now the company based near Austin is talking with investors about going private.   Investment houses are skeptical, though, that that will turn the company’s fortunes around. Obama says US troops this spring will begin taking on a supporting role in Afghanistan, as part of the winding down of our military operations there.   We’ll still be training Afghan troops – but before you know it we’ll be leading from behind. The White House announced today that the state of the union address is set for Feb. 12.   If that date sounds familiar, well, it’s Lincoln’s birthday.   But it’s also Josh Brolin’s birthday and he’s a big Obama fan. The more we’re reading about the background of what happened in last year’s presidential election, the more it seems like the two candidates didn’t really want all that much to be president.   It must have been nice to be around for the 1968 election.   Richard Nixon and Hubert Humphrey.   Now there were two guys who  really wanted to be president. Houston’s mayor Anise Parker says she’s supporting Wendy Greuel for mayor of Los Angeles.   Sorry if I sound like Andy Rooney, but I have trouble supporting anyone who’s last name reminds me of that terrible food they kept feeding Oliver Twist in the Charles Dickens novel. A study of the Texas legislature meeting this week shows that nearly a third of members are lawyers.   T hat means all you have to do is stand there in the senate or house and scream the words \"I've fallen and I can't get up\" -- you may draw a crowd. Most of all, it’s nice to know that new Texas US Senator Ted Cruz has a sense of humor.   After spending a week getting settled in Washington, he landed in Texas and said, \"It's great to be back in America!\" Politics as practiced in Washington today is doing serious harm to the nation.   That’s the takeaway from today’s Gallup poll – 68-percent of democrats agree – 79-percent of Independents – 87-percent of Republicans agree --   politics as usual is bad for America. Lots of partying in Austin last night – the Texas legislature convened today at noon – Joe Straus remains speaker of the House – politicos will be settling in for a couple of days before they face a number of problems, including the increasingly scarce and important resource – water.   The Obama administration will be around another four years – so if you’ve got big bucks its time to get on board – a committee paying for the inauguration on January 21, encouraging everyone to contribute up to a million bucks.  ASAP. The National Climatic Data Center today said last year was the warmest ever.   USA Today says 2012 was the hottest year in the history of the United States.   The New York Times says, \"It’s official: 2012 was hottest year ever in US.\"   Okay.   Actually, records have only been kept since 1895, so there are plenty of years when it could have been hotter but we don’t know.   1782, perhaps.   But you can read the entire article on the New York Times website and they don’t even tell you how hot it actually was last year – but the answer is -- 2012’s average temperature was one degree higher than the previous hottest year, 1998 when the average national temperature all year was a scorching 54.3 degrees.   Masking In the Limelight   We were worried about this whole election.  As a friend of ours points out, this election was complicated and verbose and very, very expensive and it put a lot of money into my industry, broadcasting, so I enjoyed it.  And I enjoyed doing radio commentary about it, reporting the news stories about the election and hearing what people said about it and what people said about what people said and so on.   But we were worried because the whole election was a done deal days ago, if people had just been paying attention.  Oh, we were caught up in the game of politics and the usual Gotcha stuff and My Way Or the Highway stuff that politics -- and political correctness -- is all about these days.  And we were caught up in doing Hallowe'en with our kids too, so we didn't notice that an important bellwether had been mentioned in the news media.   The sales of Hallowe'en masks gave away the direction in which the election winds were blowing.  The Obama mask outsold the Romney mask by a landslide: 60% for the incumbent, 40% for the challenger.  No contest.    For heaven's sake.  Why, our friend questions, did it take Romney till November 6th -- a full 6 days after the Obama mask landslide results were in -- to concede the election? QUOTE OF THE YEAR (SO FAR:) \"Let’s get one thing clear once and for all: the only person who has ever been allowed to “reach out” (and, in her case, touch someone you love) was Diana Ross. Anyone else should just “get in touch with” their colleagues, perhaps even “write a letter” asking for their views. What was once a mild rash has become a contagious bug and we need to find a vaccine for all this reaching out. Not only is it a drippy, meaningless phrase, it also conjures up an unpleasant image of people’s sweaty paws grabbing at you. \"The people who 'reach out' are also those whose thinking is always “blue sky,\" who can’t describe anything vaguely contemporary without incorrectly enlisting phrases such as “minimalist” or “modernist” and who don’t have to hurry to the airport but need to “rocket” there. But for now if we can just get everyone to delete “reach out” from their memory banks, opening our emails will be a less tense experience. And if they don’t, perhaps we’ll have to reach out – and grab them by the throat.\" -- Monocle magazine More of TheLatest.Net             Mike Shiloh, editor at TheLatest.Net, is an award-winning broadcast news reporter, anchor and Internet writer, a regular on CNN , as heard on WINK News Radio, KNTH, KKHT, KTRH, KRBE, KILT, KKHT, KKBQ, KVST, KNTH, KSEV and KQUE.

He is reeling from a crisis in global credibility after being caught monitoring German Chancellor own cell phone. What next? The list is long, including a battle royal on immigration policy that could wreck his Halloween. Grumbling Democrats are now realizing these battles are blowing up in their own face. No longer is it possible to just \"blame Republicans\" for any rat running across the yard of the White House, too many trails lead back to the President's own feet.

When times got tough, he abandoned the relationship and adopted dusty zero-sum gain policies of his predecessors. To allies and rivals alike, he looks naïve, weak, and disconnected. This is the portrait presented Sunday by Peter Baker in his front-page New York Times story titled, \"In Cold War Echo, Obama Strategy Writes Off Putin.\" What struck me about the piece is the unstated parallel between Obama´s handling of Russia and Republicans, and how in both cases the gap between promise and performance illustrates a fundamental A Marine´s story: Women set up to fail USMC’s most grueling test ABC News, by Martha Raddatz*     Original Article Posted By: NorthernDog - 4/21/2014 11:13:10 AM     Post Reply At a petite 5’3’’, Sage Santangelo may not look like a combat fighter at first glance.

One of the little tricks that keeps the Beltway media-special interest alliance prosperously spinning along has been exposed to the light of day by Washington Post blogger Eric Wemple. In a long piece devoted to Politico’s Mike Allen, Wemple chronicles the confluence of advertising and journalism via what a practice called “native advertising,” inserting material that looks like it could be an ordinary item written by a journalist, but which actually is paid advertising.

But health care policy wonks have something else on their mind now: the cost of health care. It’s starting to rise more quickly than before. That could be a problem. For the last four years or so, national health care expenditures—that is, all the money that Americans spend on medical services and supplies—has been growing at historically low rates. It’s gone up every year, as it almost always does, but only by 3 or 4 percent. That’s just a little bit more than inflation. Typically health care spending has risen more quickly. George W.

A previously undisclosed directive Bush signed almost two years after leaving office could result in many of his official records becoming public faster than those of his predecessor, President Bill Clinton, experts say — a move that’s drawing praise from unlikely quarters.Bush’s letter to the National Archives about his presidential records, obtained by POLITICO under the Freedom of Information Act, establishes nine categories of documents cleared for release to the public. They include memoranda and reports provided ´Why are they trying to sell me something during the test?´ Grade- school students baffled as brands including Nike, iPods and Barbies appear in exam papers Daily Mail [UK], by Suzannah Hills     Original Article Posted By: Ribicon - 4/21/2014 10:17:40 AM     Post Reply The use of well-known brand names in school tests has led to accusations that education boards are making product placement deals. Nike, Barbie, iPod, Life Savers and even Mug Root Beer all appeared in a recent New York Common Core standardized English test taken by more than a million students in grades three to eight. Outraged parents have demanded an explanation for why specific brand names were used in the tests - with some suggesting they´ve become little more than just another way of advertising to young children. But New York state education officials and the test publisher insist the Downhill: Obamacare vs. ski areas Union Leader [Manchester, NH], by Staff     Original Article Posted By: nhchemist - 4/21/2014 10:12:43 AM     Post Reply Among Obamacare´s myriad negative effects on small businesses could be this: shorter ski seasons in New Hampshire. At a forum on the Affordable Care Act held last week, Greg Goddard, general manager of Gunstock Ski Resort, said the resort might shorten its season because it cannot afford to offer health insurance to its full-time seasonal employees who work for more than 120 consecutive days, as the law requires. \"We may not be able to open beyond 120 days; it may be Christmas to the middle of March ... the summer season may be the fourth of July until Labor Day,\"    B-G1 Obama´s Good News Isn´t Getting Across Bloomberg, by Albert R. Hunt     Original Article Posted By: garnet - 4/21/2014 10:03:24 AM     Post Reply Here´s a bit of good news for nervous Democrats: President Barack Obama´s health-care law isn´t going to be the albatross many feared it would be in this year´s congressional elections. Enrollment has soared, and the Congressional Budget Office estimates that the program will cost less than initially projected and that premiums will rise only slightly this year. House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi and Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid aren´t popping the Champagne, however. The economy could clobber Democrats in November. And the president continues to alternate between telling Americans how much better things are and deploring how many are being left Buffalo, N.Y., Gathers Pussy Willows for Dyngus Day Wall Street Journal, by Will Connors     Original Article Posted By: StormCnter - 4/21/2014 9:39:04 AM     Post Reply To prepare for Dyngus Day, Eddy Dobosiewicz drives to an abandoned lot in east Buffalo, N.Y., in search of an elusive commodity: pussy willows. Dyngus Day celebrations, to be staged Monday in Buffalo and a handful of other U.S. cities, trace their roots to ancient Polish fertility rites centered around the end of Lent and the advent of spring. As part of the festivities, young men traditionally splash water on women they fancy. Women carry pussy willow branches to hit the men they like. But this year, after an especially harsh winter, Dyngus Day organizers are worried that there won´t be enough Sharyl Attkisson charges Media Matters helps produce news reports for CBS American Thinker, by Thomas Lifson     Original Article Posted By: Dreadnought - 4/21/2014 9:39:02 AM     Post Reply Now that she has left CBS News, Sharyl Attkisson is revealing all sorts of interesting facts about the way news is shaped by ideologues. Appearing on CNN’s Reliable Sources (transcript) Attkisson: “Media Matters, as my understanding, is a far left blog group that I think holds itself out to be sort of an independent watchdog group. And yes, they clearly targeted me at some point. They used to work with me on stories and tried to help me produce my stories, and at some point” (emphasis added) Well, well, well.

Egypt’s real problem is more prosaic -- the mismatch between an agricultural system that can feed 40 million and a population of 84 million. [SNIP] The total food subsidy system costs about $4.4 billion per year. With the bulk of the population’s calories provided by subsidized bread from effectively communal bakeries, there is almost no resilience in the food supply system in Egypt. If the imports or the subsidies stop, Egyptians will starve. Ron Wyden: Free Trader? American Magazine, by Claude Barfield     Original Article Posted By: eagleblurst - 4/21/2014 9:20:19 AM     Post Reply It’s a new ball game in the Senate on trade: Senator Ron Wyden (D-Oregon), who has succeeded Senator Max Baucus (D-Montana), as chairman of the Finance Committee, seems understandably determined to place his own stamp on trade policy — including on legislation to provide special procedures for congressional vetting of new trade agreements (so-called Trade Promotion Authority), and on the substance of the agreements now being negotiated. The new chairman has made it clear he would scrap, or substantially alter, the bipartisan TPA bill crafted by Senator Baucus, in alliance with House Ways and Means Committee Chairman... [Snip] Don´t Believe the Spin, Obamacare Is Still a Loser Creators Syndicate, by Scott Rasmussen     Original Article Posted By: garnet - 4/21/2014 9:15:01 AM     Post Reply President Barack Obama announced triumphantly that 8 million people selected a private insurance plan through the health care exchanges created by legislation known as Obamacare or the Affordable Care Act. He added his own interpretation of the numbers: \"This thing is working.\" At the same time, however, Democratic candidates across the country still see the health care law as a drag on their campaigns in the midterm elections. After four years of trying, there is still no evidence that the president´s signature piece of legislation has become popular.

Her first column, including the pros of smoking from a “tape pen,” made its debt on Thursday, the New York Post reported. In it, she explained how marijuana actually helps with the pressure and pain of glaucoma and that using a vaporizing pen — rather than rolling a joint or breathing from a bong —    Shelly O — The first lady comes in last Washington Times, by Joseph Curl     Original Article Posted By: Toledo - 4/21/2014 8:26:25 AM     Post Reply First ladies, almost from the beginning, have taken up lofty causes when they move into the White House. Dolley Madison concerned herself with the plight of orphans. Ellen Wilson, shocked by the squalid streets of Washington, took up urban housing (and even got a bill through Congress, the first FLOTUS to do so). Rosalynn Carter made her signature issue mental health. Nancy Reagan took on youth drug abuse. Hillary Rodham Clinton made health care her cause. Laura Bush pushed reading. And Michelle Obama took on the weighty issues of — fitness and food. Oh, and fat kids.

Debbie Wasserman Schultz (D-Fla.) told NBC´s \"Meet the Press\" on Sunday. \"[T]hese elections, particularly the Senate elections, are referendums on the candidates running,\" she said. Asked about vulnerable Democrats who have criticized President Obama´s flawed healthcare law, Wasserman Schultz said they are running their own race. \"They have to talk about and focus on the issues that are important to their constituents.

There is nothing like it in the democracies of Europe, which came into being with nations already carved up into private fiefdoms. The Great Idea that hundreds of millions of acres of forests, deserts, rivers and prairies should be owned by, and managed for, the public interest has had a profound and lasting influence on American culture. But not everyone has accepted it. Cliven Bundy’s armed standoff with the National Park Oscar Pistorius took acting lessons to ready for teary performance at trial: report New York Daily News, by Bill Hutchinson     Original Article Posted By: Toledo - 4/21/2014 7:57:49 AM     Post Reply He’s an Oscar whiner. Legless Olympian Oscar Pistorius took acting lessons to prep for his sobbing testimony in his sensational murder trial, claims a top South African journalist. Jani Allan, a former columnist for the South African Sunday Times, claims her “close friend” — a famous South African actor — coached Pistorius for his appearance in the courtroom drama. “I have it from a reliable source that you are taking acting lessons for your days in court,” Allan wrote in an open letter to Pistorius she posted on her blog. “Your coach has an impossible task,” quipped Allan, 60, whom Why the GOP Needs a Return to the Bush Leagues Daily Beast, by Robert Shrum     Original Article Posted By: tisHimself - 4/21/2014 7:26:46 AM     Post Reply Does anyone really believe Ted Cruz, Rand Paul, or Chris Christie can contend against Hillary Clinton? At least Jeb, the establishment’s establishmentarian, would put up a fight. The GOP may have to return to the Bush leagues. Here’s why. In presidential nominating contests, the Republican establishment has always won out—from the first Bush, to the tried but tired Dole, to W., then McCain, and most recently Romney, who nonetheless had to labor mightily to emerge from the weakest field of candidates in either party, ever.
